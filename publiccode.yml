    shortDescription: Central repository holding an architecture model for documenting components and their relations in a microservice-based system architecture
    longDescription: >
      The jEAP Architecture Repository Service (Arch Repo) is a central architecture repository holding the 
      architecture model for documenting components and their relations in a microservice-based system architecture.
      It maintains an up-to-date inventory of microservices, their relationships, events, and interfaces, and 
      automatically generates architecture documentation from this data. The Arch Repo focuses on system architecture 
      and integrates information from multiple sources, publishing the resulting architecture model to Confluence.
    features:
      - Maintains an up-to-date inventory of microservices, relationships, and interfaces
      - Integrates multiple data sources to automatically generate architecture documentation
      - Publishes architecture models to Confluence
